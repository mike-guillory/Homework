Hello, my name is Mike Guillory.

I have some previous web development experience, having built a couple of websites for a Bed and Breakfast and a music CD, which included APIs for scheduling requests and content management. Also, I’ve completed a two year course in Computer Programming and I’m currently enrolled in an online Web Development boot camp to refresh my old skills and learn some new ones.

For several months I’ve been keeping track of my many bills with an Excel spreadsheet and I’ve found it extremely helpful. So, for my boot camp capstone project I decided to automate this payment planning process with an app that could be quite useful to anyone who has bills to pay, especially many of the 60% of Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck.

It seems most people are hesitant to do an actual budget, but this will not be a budgeting app, it’s simply something that will help them to keep track of their bills and have a better understanding of how much money they have to work with once the bills are paid. This means that people will be more likely to use it.
The app is built with standard web technologies, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, and JavaScript on both the front and back ends with ES6 and Node.js.

Let me show you what I’ve built!
