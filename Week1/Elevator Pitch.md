---

I’ve built a web application that helps people to keep track of their bills and enables them to see the big picture of their week-to-week, month-to-month financial situation.

This app is for anyone who pays bills, but will be especially useful for the 60% of Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck.

The great thing about my app is that it’s not a budgeting app. Most people balk at the suggestion of making a budget. My app is just a fast and simple way for people to see what’s going on with their bills verses their income, and so it’s much more likely to be used.

Let me show you how simple and powerful it is.
